I'm optimizing the crystallinity of an aluminum-based MOF using a microwave-assisted synthesis method. Can you coordinate your team to help me improve the synthesis parameters and lab setup?

Here are the details of the initial synthesis condition:
- Linker-to-metal ratio: 1.5
- Modulator: acetic acid
- Concentration: 0.05 M
- Linker-to-modulator ratio: 1:20
- Reaction time: 15 minutes
- Reaction temperature: 130°C

Please propose three task options for next steps, and assign each one to a specialist in your team. I’m ready to proceed with their suggestions.
